1- If we can guarantee reliable data transfer at the link layer, then the end-to-end reliability can be also guaranteed.

2- Suppose the following bit string is received by the data link layer from the network layer: 01110111101111101111110. Then the resulting string after bit stuffing is 0111011110111110011111010.

3- Since CSMA performs carrier sensing before data transfer, the possibility of packet collision becomes smaller. That is why CSMA attains higher throughout than ALOHA.

4- A full-duplex point-to-point ethernet link does not require CSMA/CD.

5- Given two hosts A and B. A's IP is 111.111.111.111/24, and B's IP is 222.222.222.222/24. Suppose that A's ARP table is empty at the beginning. If A wants to talk to B, A needs to generate an ARP request first to acquire B's MAC address.

7- If we divide a switch into two VLANs, then the two VLANs need to connect to a router in order to communicate.

ANSWER
1- If we can guarantee reliable data transfer at the link layer, then the end-to-end reliability can be also guaranteed.
False. The end-to-end reliability is associated with other layers such as network layer, transport layer and so one. For example, if an end-to-end system uses UDP, even though link layer is reliable, we cannot promise the end-to-end reliability.

2- Suppose the following bit string is received by the data link layer from the network layer: 01110111101111101111110. Then the resulting string after bit stuffing is 0111011110111110011111010.
True. Bit stuffing requires add one 0 after 5 continuous 0's.

3- Since CSMA performs carrier sensing before data transfer, the possibility of packet collision becomes smaller. That is why CSMA attains higher throughout than ALOHA.
True.

4- A full-duplex point-to-point ethernet link does not require CSMA/CD.
True. For this situation, there will be no collision.

5- Given two hosts A and B. A's IP is 111.111.111.111/24, and B's IP is 222.222.222.222/24. Suppose that A's ARP table is empty at the beginning. If A wants to talk to B, A needs to generate an ARP request first to acquire B's MAC address.
False. They are not in the same subnet, A need to acquire the mid router's MAC address first.

6- Compared with a hub, a switch can reduce a LAN's collision region.
True.

7- If we divide a switch into two VLANs, then the two VLANs need to connect to a router in order to communicate.
True.

8- L2 switches are plug and play, using self-learning to construct switch tables. In contrast, L3 switches require manual configuration.
True.

9- We should avoid building network topologies with cycles, because of the ARP storm.
False. Although there is ARP storm, it could be reduced by network layer. And network topologies with cycles have many benefits.

10- The MAC layer is always implemented in NIC, while the transport layer is always implemented in software.
False. The transport layer could be implemented in hardware also.
