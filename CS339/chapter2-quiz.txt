Answer
1-Consider an HTTP Web server using persistent connections. Suppose the server spawns a separate process for each client that connects to the server. Then each of these spawned processes will have different server port numbers.
False. The HTTP is fixed in port 80 at the server.

2- Applications using UDP service are always unreliable.
False, although UDP is an unreliable transport protocol, the appilication achieved above it could make the transmission reliable by other measurements.

3- Since HTTP is stateless, it cannot offer personalized services for different users.
False. HTTP is stateless, however, there is crookie to ensure individual information be stored while web connections.

4- FTP is out of band, as it uses separate channels to send control and data messages.
True. FTP uses two different TCP connections to make control connection and data connection.

5- Email uses push protocols.
False. Email uses pull protocols, in which the clients send request first and wait for servers to answer.

6- Unlike UDP, TCP can provide a throughput guarantee.
False. Both UDP and TCP cannot provide with a throughput guarantee. Their difference lies in that TCP offers without data loss.

7- DNS can offer load balancing service.
True. DNS has a local domain name server to cache domain information, thus balance is loaded for root DNS, TLD, and Zones and Authoritative DNS.

8- HTTP always runs on top of TCP.
False. For example in HTTP3.0, it could run on top of UDP.

9- In the client-server model, if a server fails, its clients should always be notified.
False. If a client is not on, it should not be notified. On the other hand, if the number of clients is too large, it'll be costly for server to notify the clients.

10- On the same server, two sockets can bind to the same port.
False. A port can only be binded with one socket.
